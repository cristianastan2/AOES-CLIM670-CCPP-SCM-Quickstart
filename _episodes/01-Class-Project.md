### Description of Project
In this class, you will learn to perform hypothesis driven experiments with an Earth System Model.  You will complete a class project that involves application of the skills from this class to your own model experiments.  The project will consist of:

* A written paper describing your scientific question, hypothesis, experiment design, and results. 
* An oral presentation to the class describing the project

You may perform proof-of-concept experiments on a scientific question related to your graduate research and/or interests  or you may reproduce the results from a journal article in which experiments were performed using climate model.  You should use CESM for your experiments.
